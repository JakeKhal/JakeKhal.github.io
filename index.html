      <h2 class="section-title">👨‍💻 About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Oregon with a focus on cybersecurity. 
        I currently work at the university’s Cybersecurity Operations Center where I build tools to detect threats and created a website that helps users track their IT tickets, training, and mail limit. 
        I also helped design and build a platform for the UO Cybersecurity Club to support Capture the Flag challenges. 
        I built a phishing detection Chrome extension that gives users real-time feedback on suspicious emails. 
        I also volunteer as a website developer for a nonprofit called Our Giving Table, where I help keep the site updated and improve the experience for donors. 
        I'm confident working with Python, C/C++, Flask, Linux, and Microsoft security tools. 
        Right now, I’m looking for a job where I can keep growing and contribute to meaningful work.      </p>

        <h3>🧠 Phishing Detection Extension</h3>
        <p>The Phishing Detection Extension is a Chrome extension designed to analyze email content and detect potential phishing attempts.</p>
        <p>It provides users with a phishing confidence score (0-100) for emails viewed in Gmail, helping them identify and avoid malicious attacks.</p>
        <p>This tool is designed for everyday users, providing a simple, one-click email analysis without requiring technical expertise.</p>
        <p>The extension extracts email content, sends it to an AI-powered backend, and returns a phishing risk assessment using GPT-4 and VirusTotal.</p>

        <h3>🛡️ SecureU Dashboard</h3>
        <p>The SecureU Dashboard is a web tool developed at the University of Oregon Information Services to give users a clear view of their account security.</p>
        <p>I was part of the backend engineering team and also helped organize parts of the frontend. The dashboard connects to LDAP, uses internal CGI scripts, and integrates external APIs like Have I Been Pwned.</p>
        <p>It displays: • Email Sending limit • Password status (last reset and expiration) • Cybersecurity training progress • Third-party data breach info</p>
        <p>The tool was designed to be user-friendly and informative, helping non-technical users stay aware of their security status.</p>
